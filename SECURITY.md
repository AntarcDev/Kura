## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Kura seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.** This gives potential attackers a chance to exploit the vulnerability before we can fix it.
2.  **Email the maintainer** directly at [kxantarc@tuta.io](mailto:kxantarc@tuta.io).
3.  **Provide details**: Include as much information as possible to help us reproduce the issue.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
